# Data Structures and Algorithm Series using Java by (Anish singh rawat)

## Explanations using java

- [first java program](/PatternPrint/Day%201/FirstProgram.java)

## Contribution Guidelines

1. i have Create folders through naming convenstion and program of the java is insside the folders like file_name.java.
2. To each new file, i write the code for solving DSA `problem`.
3. The folder name can also only contain **lowercase characters** and **dashes** or **hyphens** (`-`) (Eg. `strings` `sorting` etc.)

**Folder Structure**

```bash
problem-name
| - all folders through it's naming convenstion     
| - open any folder by logic name
| - open any folder by day
| - problem_name.java
    | - file_name.java
```

- **java**: `file_name.java`

#### Source Code File

The source code files should either be inside the folder (**Eg.** `logic_file_name/Day/file.java`).

Again, the source codes must conform to a valid file structure convention that the programming language enforces.

### 2. Naming Convention

The programming is java the naming convention rule of programming language.
