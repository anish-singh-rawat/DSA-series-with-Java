# Data Structures and Algorithm

Data structure and Algorithm using Java

## Explanations using java
- [first java program](/Day%201/FirstProgram.java)

## Contribution Guidelines

1. i have Create a new folder and an folder_name.java for it inside.
2. To each new file, i write the code for solving DSA `problem`.
3. The folder name can also only contain **lowercase characters** and **dashes** or **hyphens** (`-`) (Eg. `strings` `sorting` etc.)

**Folder Structure**

```bash
problem-name\
| - README.md
| - all folders through Day whise     
| - open any folder 
    | - folder_name.java
```


- **java**: `Day_and_file_name.java`

#### Source Code File

The source code files should either be inside the folder (**Eg.** `Day/file.java`).

Again, the source codes must conform to a valid file structure convention that the programming language enforces.

### 2. Naming Convention

The programming is  java the naming convention rule of programming language.
